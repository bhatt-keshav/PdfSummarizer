The Compensation & Management Development Committee 
(CMDC) of the Board maintains independent oversight of our 
compensation programs, including executive compensation. At the Board level, the CMDC provides oversight of the governance 
framework of our firmwide culture, including reviewing updates 
from management regarding significant conduct issues. Anti-Money Laundering
Compliance with the laws and regulations governing anti-
money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing, economic 
sanctions and anti-corruption efforts is an important focus of 
our control agenda. In 2018, shareholders demonstrated strong support for 
our program with a 93% vote in favor of our annual resolution to 
approve executive compensation. Our Proxy Statement contains 
a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section that includes 
further details of our executive pay program.
