0 At the Board level, the CMDC provides oversight of the governance 
framework of our firmwide culture, including reviewing updates 
from management regarding significant conduct issues.
1 In 
determining individual compensation for Operating Committee 
members, the CMDC uses a balanced and discretionary approach 
to assess performance against each individual’s goals associated 
with four broad categories: (i) Business Results; (ii) Risk, Controls 
& Conduct, including feedback received from the Firm’s risk and 
control professionals; (iii) Client/Customer/Stakeholder Focus, 
including our engagement in communities; and (iv) Teamwork 
& Leadership, including creating a diverse and inclusive 
environment that encourages employees to speak up.
2 Our compensation program is designed to incentivize long-term, 
sustainable decision-making and to hold individuals accountable, 
when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that negatively 
impact business performance or the Firm’s reputation.
3 This 
includes having in place employee training and protocols for 
preventing, reporting and addressing behavior that is not in line 
with our Business Principles and standards, including sexual, 
discriminatory or other misconduct.
4 Our Corporate Culture 
In 2018, we continued to strengthen and reinforce our culture, 
with a focus on fostering an environment where all employees 
adhere to the highest ethical standards and uphold our Business 
Principles (p. 31) in all of their engagements.
